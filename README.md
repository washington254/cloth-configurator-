## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

So i realised not a lot of threejs configurators are out there(if there are i found a few) so i decided to create one of my own. i figured it might help you get a direction of what to do

Here's why:
* created a platform and tweaked it a bit to changed colors based on UI
* added the shirt from a  model online sketchfab license below
